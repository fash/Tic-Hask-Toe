-- Higher Order Functions
-- Anonymous Functions(Lamda Expression & Operation sections)
-- Predicates
-- Dim function 
-- Folds (to main variations foldr & foldl) takes a list and repeatedly applies a binaray function to it reducing it into an accumulated value also known as reduce in other languages
-- The accumulated value can be anything .
-- Aggregate it into some summary valuue 
--For loops are the same as foldr/foldl(accumulator is on the right for foldr and on the left for foldl)
